# go-bmi

`Go-BMI` is a simple applicatoin that I am building to help me continue my learning and training in Golang.

The idea is to build a user interface for a user to input their `height`, `weight`, which will be used to compute their BMI. 
the result will then display the category that belongs to the user.  

  
 ### BMI Categories:
  - `underweight` = <18.5
  - `normal weight` = 18.5-24.9
  - `overweight` = 25-29.9
  - `obesity` = BMI of 30 or greater
  


## For Height: 
- feet and inches
- we will then extend the functionality to also include: `meters`, `centimeters`

## For Weight:
- pounds
- for extending it: we will include `kilograms`

```
### Formula:
BMI = kg/m2
Kg is a person's weight in kilograms, and m2 is there height in metres squared. 
```
